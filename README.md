<p>Hello,</p>
<p>My name is Miles David Victor Buckle.
I am 19 years old but 20 tomorrow...</p>
<p>That was a pause for your polite wish of happy birthday, or maybe you didn't and I have just embarresed myself? anyway.
I was born on the 30th of November 2002 in number 17 Shaftesbury Road, Brighton England to two parents, and an older sister.</p>
<p>I am pretty moody, I enjoy moaning about things. I enjoy cleaning. I don't like hassle, mess and stress. This makes me quite an irritating person to be around 
although I do like humour, laughter is fun.</p>
<p>If you were to download me and I became a sort of companion commenting on what it was you were doing then you would probably not have me installed for very long
as you would soon realise all I am going to do is tell you to tidy, stop being so heavy handed, calm down... anyway. Im going to go now as youre probably sick of me.
Goodbye.</p>
